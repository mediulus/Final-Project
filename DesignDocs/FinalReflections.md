# Final Reflections

## Christina
Working in a team taught me how powerful collaboration can be. One person might notice a bug that another can quickly fix, and together we could catch issues that would have been easy to miss individually. It was rewarding to see our designs come to life and evolve as we incorporated everyone’s perspectives on how the app should look and function.


I also learned how important strong communication and asynchronous collaboration are, especially when multiple people are working on the same files. Merge conflicts can be difficult to resolve, particularly when using Copilot, which sometimes modifies many files at once. This experience taught me to commit and push more frequently after small, successful changes rather than waiting for larger milestones like I did for my personal project.


Finally, user testing was an interesting additional part of the process. It showed that some features we thought might confuse users were actually intuitive, while users found different bugs and made suggestions we hadn’t anticipated. Seeing real users interact with the app made me appreciate the importance of feedback and iteration.

The final project showed me just how quickly an ambitious app idea can take shape when working with a team of passionate and driven group members. The four of us all brought different strengths and areas of expertise to the project, so we were able to bounce ideas off of one another and lean on each other for help. This made the work more manageable and enjoyable, and in the end it was so rewarding to have created a functional app that could potentially benefit the entire MIT community.

Moreover, the additional step of user testing taught me just how much a developer can miss from their side of things: there were many seemingly obvious improvements pointed out by my participant that had somehow slipped our minds. Thus, it was both fun and valuable to gain insight and feedback on our app from an outside perspective.

Finally, in dealing with a more complex project, I realized just how many decisions go into the user interface. Iterating on the component views, page structure, and more showed me that each individual choice makes a difference, and that smaller details from navigation bar placement to tag coloring can truly bring the app to life. Ultimately, creating Dam Good Housing was a fun and meaningful experience that showed me the value of an exciting idea and a strong team to make it possible.

Overall, I greatly enjoyed this group project. I believe that we worked together well, communicated often, and found ways to find common ground on differing ideas. We learned quickly how important communication was, as each change or update mandated some communication. For example, in order to implement the Google Maps view, I needed to communicate effectively with Megan in order to use her Listings and Postings APIs.
Further than just having a different process of creation, working in a group allowed for me to work on an idea that I would never have considered on my own. This issue addressing facilitating summer housing began with a different group member, and evolved quickly during our discussions to what it is now. That form of bouncing ideas off of each other allowed for creativity, while keeping the future implementation in mind. Often when constructing an idea it can be easy to lose sight of how difficult or simple the actual implementation can be. With multiple people ideating at the same time, checks and balances can be put into place in order to restrict the complexity to realistic proportions.
I learned how important user testing was during this group project. While some aspects of the website design came naturally to me (example: the minimum cost of housing being a filter), the user testing helped highlight which parts were unintuitive to those who were using the website. This greatly improved the quality and usability of our website as a result.

This project was such a cool experience. Most of my classes have been centered around problem sets where you are given a small problem to solve with very little autonomy. In contrast, with 6.104 I loved being able to truly think about what my teammates and I were passionate about and build a project around that. It was exciting to solve unique, open-ended problems, and I am especially proud that we now have a project that we can all truly call our own.
On the technical side, I learned how important it is to think carefully about both design and how you prompt an LLM. One of the issues I ran into was that each post on different pages was not imported as a shared component, but instead was almost copied from one place to another, which is something we are taught early on not to do. I found it interesting that the LLM did not naturally create a separate reusable card component, and I now realize that I could have prompted that more carefully. This became a problem when posts on different pages developed different bugs, meaning we had to apply fixes in multiple places. I also learned that when working on a larger project, there are many more opportunities for bugs, so it is crucial to thoroughly test functionality to make sure that fixing one issue does not break something else.
This project also taught me a lot about working in a group. I was fortunate to have wonderful partners, and we truly did not run into any conflicts throughout the process. Even so, communicating updates, changes, and timelines was extremely important, especially when it came to coordinating bug fixes and design changes. I think everyone did a great job of carrying their own weight, which made the collaboration smooth and enjoyable. Overall, I found this project incredibly fun and rewarding!
