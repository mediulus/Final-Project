# Final Reflections

## Christina
Working in a team taught me how powerful collaboration can be. One person might notice a bug that another can quickly fix, and together we could catch issues that would have been easy to miss individually. It was rewarding to see our designs come to life and evolve as we incorporated everyone’s perspectives on how the app should look and function.


I also learned how important strong communication and asynchronous collaboration are, especially when multiple people are working on the same files. Merge conflicts can be difficult to resolve, particularly when using Copilot, which sometimes modifies many files at once. This experience taught me to commit and push more frequently after small, successful changes rather than waiting for larger milestones like I did for my personal project.


Finally, user testing was an interesting additional part of the process. It showed that some features we thought might confuse users were actually intuitive, while users found different bugs and made suggestions we hadn’t anticipated. Seeing real users interact with the app made me appreciate the importance of feedback and iteration.


## Kailey:

The final project showed me just how quickly an ambitious app idea can take shape when working with a team of passionate and driven group members. The four of us all brought different strengths and areas of expertise to the project, so we were able to bounce ideas off of one another and lean on each other for help. This made the work more manageable and enjoyable, and in the end it was so rewarding to have created a functional app that could potentially benefit the entire MIT community.

Moreover, the additional step of user testing taught me just how much a developer can miss from their side of things: there were many seemingly obvious improvements pointed out by my participant that had somehow slipped our minds. Thus, it was both fun and valuable to gain insight and feedback on our app from an outside perspective.

Finally, in dealing with a more complex project, I realized just how many decisions go into the user interface. Iterating on the component views, page structure, and more showed me that each individual choice makes a difference, and that smaller details from navigation bar placement to tag coloring can truly bring the app to life. Ultimately, creating Dam Good Housing was a fun and meaningful experience that showed me the value of an exciting idea and a strong team to make it possible.
