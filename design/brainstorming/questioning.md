# response:

To answer "Why...", I need to know *what* you're asking about!

"Why" questions typically ask for:
*   A **reason**
*   A **cause**
*   A **purpose**
*   An **explanation**

Please complete your question so I can provide a helpful response. For example:

*   "Why is the sky blue?"
*   "Why did that happen?"
*   "Why should I do this?"
*   "Why is that important?"

Once you complete the question, I'll do my best to provide an answer!
